# Dive Into Python 3 #
## By: Mark Pilgrim##


I am following the [Dive Into Python 3 | Mark Pilgrim](http://www.diveintopython3.net "Dive Into Python 3 by Mark Pilgrim"), and will try to finish this book as part of my learning Python. I am not aware of any copyright issues, but will upload in [my Github profile](https://github.com/archeranimesh/) for the version control on my study.

This is a notes taking repository which will have code and my understanding of the course. Kindly mail me if there an issue with copyright will try to remove it.
